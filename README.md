# [Project 2: Data-Analysis-Team-Project](https://github.com/kwadwo-kyei/Data-Analysis-Team-Project)

In this assignment, our team was tasked with conducting an analysis utilizing various data on Carribean countries from the World Bank. With our data we were expected to:

* Conduct an exploratory data analysis of our chosen region using Python
* Formulate a strategy for our missing values and identify potential outliers
* Select one country from our region that best represents our region "on average".(Include the rationale for your choice and support it with Python code)
* Identify any obscure findings in our data. In other words "Does our data accurately reflect the region? Can our region's numbers be trusted?"
* Develop a Jupyter Notebook on our process and findings

# [Project 3: Visual-Storytelling-Through-Excel](https://github.com/kwadwo-kyei/Visual-Storytelling-Through-Excel)
This visual storytelling assignment required the use of a company's financial document to
create an excel dashboard which would then be used to best potray the company's financial
situation through the use of graphs. These graphs would then be used to generate recommendations 
to the company on what needs to be improved in their financial situation.
